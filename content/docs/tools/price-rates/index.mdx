# Price Rates

Pricing utilities for WDK apps. Includes HTTP clients and providers to retrieve current and historical prices from supported services.

Powered by [`@tetherto/wdk-pricing-bitfinex-http`](https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-pricing-bitfinex-http) and compatible with [`@tetherto/wdk-pricing-provider`](https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-pricing-provider).

## Features

- **Current Prices**: Fetch latest price for a base/quote pair (e.g., BTC/USD)
- **Historical Series**: Retrieve historical price series; long histories optionally downscaled to ≤ 100 points
- **Provider Compatibility**: Works with `@tetherto/wdk-pricing-provider`
- **Lightweight HTTP Client**: Minimal dependencies; easy to integrate

## Why this matters

- Consistent pricing is required for balance valuations, charts, and quotes
- A unified client reduces integration time and data handling errors
