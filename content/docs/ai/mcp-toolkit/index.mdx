# MCP Toolkit

The MCP Toolkit lets AI agents interact with self-custodial WDK wallets. It creates an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that exposes wallet operations (checking balances, sending transactions, swapping tokens, bridging assets, and more) as structured tools that any MCP-compatible AI client can call.

Powered by [`@tetherto/wdk-mcp-toolkit`](https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-mcp-toolkit).

## Features

- **MCP Server Extension** - Extends the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` McpServer with WDK-specific capabilities
- **Multi-Chain** - Support for 13 blockchains out of the box, including EVM chains, Bitcoin, Solana, Spark, TON, and Tron
- **35 Built-in Tools** - Ready-to-use tools for wallets, pricing, indexer queries, swaps, bridges, lending, and fiat on/off-ramps
- **Human Confirmation** - All write operations use MCP elicitations to require explicit user approval before broadcasting transactions
- **Extensible** - Register custom tools alongside built-in ones using standard MCP SDK patterns
- **Secure by Design** - Seed phrases stay local, `close()` wipes keys from memory, and read/write tool separation lets you control access

You can register **any** blockchain name - the `CHAINS` constants are for convenience only. For custom chains, register tokens manually with `registerToken()`.
