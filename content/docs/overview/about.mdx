# About WDK

The **Wallet Development Kit _by Tether_ (WDK)** is Tether's open-source toolkit that empowers humans, machines and AI agents alike to build, deploy and use secure, multi-chain, self-custodial wallets that can be integrated anywhere from the smallest embedded device to any mobile, desktop and server operating system.

A developer-first framework designed for maximum flexibility and scalability, powering anything from consumer wallets to wallet-enabled apps, DeFi integrations (lending, swaps, ...), IoT use cases, and AI agents.

Unlike closed solutions or SaaS-based wallet infrastructure providers, WDK offers zero lock-in and is designed for maximum flexibility and extensibility. It is modular, runs on Bare, Node.js and React-Native, thus can be embedded in a wide variety of environments.

***

## What Problems Does WDK Solve?

The current blockchain ecosystem is highly fragmented, with each blockchain requiring different SDKs, APIs, and integration approaches. This fragmentation creates significant barriers for developers who want to build truly seamless user-experiences that span across any blockchain, environment and use-case.

Traditional wallet development requires months of integration work. Developers must learn different standards, implement contrasting security practices, or rely on closed-source paid solutions which act as gatekeepers.

### **The Missing AI Foundation**

As we move toward a world where humans, machines and AI Agents need to manage digital assets safely, existing solutions fall short. AI agents will require wallets to interact in the financial infrastructure, and WDK wants to lay secure foundation that works for human, AI and IoT use cases. WDK enables trillions of self-custodial wallets.
