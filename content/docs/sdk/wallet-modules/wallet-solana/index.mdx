# @tetherto/wdk-wallet-solana Overview

A simple and secure package to manage BIP-44 wallets for the Solana blockchain. This package provides a clean API for creating, managing, and interacting with Solana wallets using BIP-39 seed phrases and Solana-specific derivation paths.

<Callout type="warn">
**Default Derivation Path Change in v1.0.0-beta.4+**

The default derivation path was updated in v1.0.0-beta.4 to match ecosystem conventions:

- **Before** (&lt;= v1.0.0-beta.3): `m/44'/501'/0'/0/{index}`
- **After** (v1.0.0-beta.4+): `m/44'/501'/{index}'/0'`

If you're upgrading from an earlier version, existing wallets created with the old path will generate different addresses. Make sure to migrate any existing wallets or use the old path explicitly if needed for compatibility.

Use [`getAccountByPath`](./api-reference#getaccountbypathpath) to supply an explicit derivation path when importing or recreating legacy wallets.
