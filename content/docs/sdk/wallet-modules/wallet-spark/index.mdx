# @tetherto/wdk-wallet-spark Overview

A simple and secure package to manage BIP-32 wallets for the Spark blockchain. This package provides a clean API for creating, managing, and interacting with Spark wallets using [BIP-39 seed phrases](../../resources/concepts#bip-39-mnemonic-seed-phrases), [BIP-44 derivation paths](../../resources/concepts#bip-44-multi-account-hierarchy), and the Spark SDK for Bitcoin [layer 2](../../resources/concepts#layer-2-solutions) functionality including [Lightning Network](../../resources/concepts#lightning-network) integration.
